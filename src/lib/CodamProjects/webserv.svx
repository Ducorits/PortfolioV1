## 🌐 Building a HTTP Server from Scratch

**Webserv** is a deep-dive into the world of web infrastructure. The task: implement your own fully-functional HTTP server similar to <a href="https://nginx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nginx</a>, without using external libraries or frameworks. The goal is to serve static content, support file uploads, and handle multiple clients through a scalable event loop.

| Language         | **Modern C++**                                                               |
| OS Compatibility | Linux & macOS (platform-specific I/O differences handled)                    |
| Network Model    | Non-blocking sockets + `poll()`-based I/O                                    |
| HTTP Support     | Core HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE`                               |
| Key Features     | Custom config file, file upload, CGI support, multi-port support             |
| Constraints      | No use of forks (except for CGI), no external libraries, no real web servers |

## ⚙️ My Contributions

I focused on designing and implementing the I/O core loop of the server, ensuring stable, efficient handling of many clients at once.

### 🧠 Scalable Context Management

We implemented a centralized `poll()` loop that handled all file descriptors through a clean abstraction layer. Each descriptor had a corresponding command object responsible for handling its behavior. This allowed the server to scale gracefully while keeping logic modular and testable.

## 📄 Key Features Implemented

- 📁 Serving static HTML, CSS, and JS content
- 📝 File uploads via HTTP POST
- 🔥 CGI execution for dynamic scripts (e.g., PHP or Python)
- 🧠 Custom configuration file parsing
- 🧾 Accurate HTTP response codes
- 🧼 Default error page support
- 🌐 Multi-port listening with routing support

---

## 🔐 Robustness

- Full non-blocking I/O via `poll()`
- One centralized I/O loop
- Clean object-oriented abstraction for file descriptor handling
- Strict error management: no unexpected crashes or hangs

## 💡 What I Learned

- How HTTP really works, down to the byte
- Scalable I/O strategies with system-level APIs
- Command pattern for decoupling context logic
- Writing and parsing configuration files
- Handling signals, timeouts, and client disconnects
- Serving static and dynamic content from scratch

> Webserv is when I finally understood HTTP — not just how it works, but **why** it works the way it does.
