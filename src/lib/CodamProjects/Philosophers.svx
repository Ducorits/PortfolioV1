> I never thought philosophy would be so deadly.

**Philosophers** introduced me to the wonderful chaos of multithreading. Simulating the famous dining philosophers problem, I had to coordinate shared resources (forks) between threads (philosophers) using **mutexes** ‚Äî all while avoiding deadlocks and starvation.

For each philospher there is only one fork at the table, but to eat they need *two*.
Each philosopher switches between thinking, eating, and sleeping, but can only eat if they‚Äôve acquired *both* forks. With the added challenge of printing precise state changes and detecting deaths within tight timing windows, the project tested both my **concurrency control** and **real-time logging**.

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Threads** for each philosopher (`pthread_create`)
- **Mutexes** for fork access (`pthread_mutex_*`)
- **Timing and starvation** logic with millisecond precision
- **Shared data** safely accessed via synchronization primitives
- **State logging** with strict formatting:
  `timestamp_in_ms X is eating`
  `timestamp_in_ms X died`
  (Messages must not overlap!)

## üß™ Arguments

```bash
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```

- All times are in milliseconds.
- Simulation ends if a philosopher dies *or* (optionally) when all have eaten enough.

## üîê Synchronization Strategy

- One mutex per fork to prevent concurrent access.
- Additional mutexes to:
  - Prevent race conditions when writing logs.
  - Safely read/update simulation state and meal times.
- Death is detected by regularly checking `time_since_last_meal`.

## üí• Challenges Faced

- Preventing **deadlocks** when multiple philosophers reach for forks at once.
- Implementing accurate **millisecond-level timing** using `gettimeofday` and `usleep`.
- Ensuring logs don't overlap in output, especially during death detection.
- Managing **clean shutdowns** when the simulation ends.

This project taught me how fragile concurrent systems can be ‚Äî and how elegant proper synchronization can feel when it all finally works.
