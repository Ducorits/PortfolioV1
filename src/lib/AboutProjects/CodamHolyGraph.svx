This is a recreation of the 42 Holy Graph. Each bubble represents a project and clicking on it reveals more information.

Each ring represents a different "rank" of projects, starting with Libft and moving outwards, the outer rings being the most advanced projects.

There are more projects in the original curriculum than shown here, these are the ones I have done.

The C projects at Codam follow strict code norms enforced by \`norminette\`. These include max 25 lines per function and 5 functions per file, encouraging clean and modular code.

C++ projects are more flexible, allowing more expressive and advanced programming patterns.


**About 42 / Codam**

42 is a global software engineering school with a peer-to-peer, project-based curriculum. There are no teachers or formal classes â€” you learn by doing and by collaborating. Codam is the Amsterdam branch.
